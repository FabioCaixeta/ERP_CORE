# ERP CORE
The [ERP CORE](https://erpinfo.org/erp-core) is a freely available online resource consisting of optimized paradigms, experiment control scripts, example data from 40 participants, data processing pipelines and analysis scripts, and a broad set of results for 7 different ERP components obtained from 6 different ERP paradigms:

* N170 (Face Perception Paradigm)

* MMN (Passive Auditory Oddball Paradigm)

* N2pc (Simple Visual Search Paradigm)

* N400 (Word Pair Judgement Paradigm)

* P3b (Active Visual Oddball Paradigm)

* LRP and ERN (Flankers Paradigm)

The experiment control scripts, data, and data analysis scripts are downloadable from the links below. 

A preprint of a journal article describing the [ERP CORE is available here](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/4azqm).

### Experiment Control Scripts and Installation Instructions
The experiment control scripts were written in Presentation. Click Here to download the scripts and installation instructions. You must download Presentation to open and run these scripts. You can download a free trial version to see the scripts.

### Data and Analysis Scripts
Analysis scripts can be found on GitHub, at: https://github.com/lucklab/ERP_CORE or in [this zip file](https://github.com/lucklab/ERP_CORE/archive/master.zip).

We also host these datasets on the OSF.io and OpenNeuro.
