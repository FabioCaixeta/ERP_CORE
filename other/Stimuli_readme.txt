Briefly:

In the P3b (Active Visual Oddball Paradigm)
In this task, a letter (A, B, C, D, or E) was presented in the center of the screen. 

For each block of trials, there was a target letter. The task is to respond whether the letter presented matches the target letter or does not match the target letter.

If the letter matches target letter, press the [TARGET_BUTTON] with your dominant hand. 

If the letter does not match  target letter, press the [NONTARGET_BUTTON] with your dominant hand.
